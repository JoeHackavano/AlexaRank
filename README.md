# AlexaRank
Scripts that help access the Alexa Web Information API

James Estes wrote me a shell script ( alexa_fetch.sh  ) 
to capture Alexa Rank Data from AWS Marketplace https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07Q71HJ3H?ref_=srh_res_product_title

Kyle Taylor then wrote some JS to parse the XML and get it into a format I could edit in a CSV
